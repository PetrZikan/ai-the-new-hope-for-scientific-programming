# AI: The New Hope for Scientific Programming?

## Goal / Purpose

What is the main goal of the course? Chaotic list of potential topics:

* collaborative "problem solving" using (mainly) Python tools and AI
* only git / GitHub can offer true collaboration over shared code / resources
* VSCode as the "main hammer"
* there is no chance we could teach Python as well: there's simply no time for that
* ChatGPT and effective prompting
* OpenAI API using Python library
* reasoning models to solve complex problems
* Agents: the hot stuff of 2025 year
* AWS: do we want to share some larger data with students? Could be an opener for cloud storage?
* Sphinx: should we want to create "lecture notes", we could use Sphinx: a main Python tool docs
* pandas / plotly?
* How to make a Python package to share code?

## Projectas

Are we going to solve some problem(s) during the course?

* simple CV as a web page
* data processing
* programming with AI
* how to write scientific article

## Lectures

Suggestions (the order is not important):

1. **Motivation and goals of the subject**, putting together list of participants as an intro into GitHub / VSCode (each student has to make a PR with her name and one of the teachers merges the content)
2. **What is LLM?** How does ChatGPT works? What is an agent?

## Services

* GitHub: We don't create any organization. Everyone work under her private account?
* OpenAI Team: $32 / user / month so we can likely allow one month only
* OpenAI API: With organization created in OpenAI Developers Portal, we can access all models with per-token pricing (the nice thing is that this can only be done using Python)
* AWS?
